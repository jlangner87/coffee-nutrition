### **_Description_**

#### I am currently working mornings at a coffee shop. I love my coffee, and I also like to track my nutrition. While many large restaurant chains have nutrition calculators built into their menu, the local mom & pop shops do not. I saw this as an oppportunity to build something that I am passionate about and to put my skills to practical use.

#### This application uses React Hooks to manage the state of the nutritional values of the drinks customers want to order. It is styled with Bootstrap 5.
